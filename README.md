# USV_Use_Case_Testing
Arduino Small Scale USV

Capstone project:
Using an off-the-shelf RC boat; convert it to a simple autonomous boat. Basic functions to move forward while maintaining a heading (currently +/- 10deg. When it detects an object (currently 60cm) it turns until the distance measurement is 120cm away. 


Components:
1. Off-the-shelf RC Boat
2. Arduino UNO
3. Ultrasonic Sensor
4. Compass Module
5. Bluetooth Module
6. Motor Shield
7. Prototype Shield
8. Power source for Arduino
9. Power source for motor shield
